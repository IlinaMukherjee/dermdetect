What is DermDetect?
DermDetect is an app that classifies skin lesions as either benign or malignant based on pictures, giving a confidence rate for each result.

Using a 16-layered Convolutional Neural Network VGG-16, DermDetect utilizes deep learning to make the detection process more accessible, efficient, and cost-free.
